## Summary

These changes collectively improve the reliability, performance, scalability, and maintainability of your codebase. They address issues like slow startup, redundant database queries, poor error feedback, blocking operations, and lack of observability. The added logging and timing make it much easier to monitor and debug the system, while caching and async refactors ensure the service can handle higher loads and recover gracefully from failures.
