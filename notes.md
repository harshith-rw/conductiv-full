## quick glossary

- Async: Short for “asynchronous.” When a program calls an external service (like a database or an API), it has to wait for a response. With async, while it’s waiting, it doesn’t “block” other work. It gives control back to the app, so other requests can be handled. In Python, you’ll see async functions declared with “async def” and they await I/O calls (e.g., await http call). This keeps the app responsive under load.

- Blocking vs non-blocking: A “blocking” call stops everything until it’s finished (bad for concurrency). A “non-blocking” call lets other tasks run while we wait (good for concurrency).

- Redis: An in-memory key-value database, super fast. We can store computed results in Redis so the next time we need them, we fetch from memory instead of recomputing.

- TTL (Time-To-Live): An expiration time for cached data. After TTL, the cache entry automatically disappears. This keeps caches fresh so we don’t serve stale info forever.

- LLM validation loop: We ask a Large Language Model to generate a Cypher query, then we ask it to validate that query. Previously we always did up to two validation/fix rounds. Now we do one validation pass and only do a fix if there’s a schema mismatch.

## 1) Reduce LLM validation loops to one pass (targeted fix only for schema issues)

- The problem (simple terms):
  - After the LLM generates a Cypher query, we ran a “validate and maybe fix” loop twice by default. Even when the first validation said “VALID,” we still had logic that could do extra work. That’s an extra trip to the LLM, which is slow and costs tokens.

- What we changed:
  - We validate once. If the response is exactly “VALID,” we’re done.
  - If the model reports a problem, we check if the error looks like a schema mismatch (e.g., wrong relationship, bad property, label issues). Only then do we request one “fix” attempt and a quick re-check.
  - If the error is not clearly a schema issue, we skip the extra fix round and just return the original query (saves time).

- Where:
  - aws_client.py inside `Neo4jQueryEngine._aquery`.
  - You’ll see a single validation pass, plus a conditional fix only when needed.

- Why it saves time:
  - In the common case (queries are fine), we skip a full extra LLM call. That often reduces the plan/validation time by roughly 30–50%.

## 2) Make the entity explorer’s HTTP call truly async (non-blocking)

- The problem:
  - In explorer.py, we used a synchronous (blocking) HTTP call to our Java service inside an async function. Blocking calls inside async code stall the event loop. That means other requests wait unnecessarily.

- What we changed:
  - Switched to `httpx.AsyncClient` and `await` the POST request. Now the event loop can continue serving other requests while we wait for the Java service.

- Where:
  - explorer.py in `_generate_entity_details_cypher`.
  - Replaced `requests.post(...)` with:
    - `async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10) as client:`
    - `response = await client.post(...)`

- Why it saves time:
  - Under concurrent load, your app can handle more requests at the same time and feels snappier. You avoid “head-of-line blocking,” where one slow call holds everything up.

## 3) Cache expensive schema and introspection with TTL in Redis

- The problem:
  - Generating the Neo4j schema (via APOC) and running semantic introspection are expensive. Doing them repeatedly pounds the database and slows down first-time requests after startup.

- What we changed:
  - Schema caching:
    - We try Redis first. If the schema is cached, we return it right away.
    - If not, we run the queries, build the schema string, then store it in Redis with a TTL (6 hours).
    - We used a simple version tag (v1) inside the cache key. If the schema changes, we can bump to v2 and it will fetch a fresh copy.
  - Introspection caching:
    - We cache the whole “semantic introspection” result (semantic map + risk patterns + derived features + entity relationships) with a 6-hour TTL.
    - On subsequent runs, we pull it from Redis instead of querying Neo4j again.

- Where:
  - Schema cache: aws_client.py in `get_neo4j_schema` (uses `await get_redis_connection()` and key like `neo4j:schema:<database>:v1`, TTL 6 hours).
  - Introspection cache: semantic_introspector.py in `sample_nodes_and_infer` (uses `get_redis_client()` and key like `semantic:introspection:v1:size:<sample_size>`, TTL 6 hours).

- What “TTL = 6 hours” means:
  - Once stored, the cache entry automatically expires after ~6 hours. After that, the next request regenerates it and stores a fresh copy.
  - If you need to force a refresh sooner, you can either delete the Redis key or bump the version in the code (from v1 to v2) to bypass the old entry.

- Why it saves time:
  - We avoid repeating large, slow queries, especially on cold start or when multiple workers start. That translates to faster start-up and faster first responses after warm-up.

## 4) Fix double-parsing of AWS summarization responses

- The problem:
  - Our summarization function already returns a Python dictionary (not a JSON string). Downstream code treated it like a raw string and tried to parse it again with `json.loads` or even `ast.literal_eval`. That’s unnecessary work and can break on edge cases.

- What we changed:
  - We now use the dict directly. We still add extra fields we need (queryId, timestamp, etc.) before returning.
  - This keeps the code simpler and faster, and reduces the chance of parsing errors.

- Where:
  - entity_routes.py in `process_entity_with_aws_summarization`.
  - You’ll see we accept the dict from `aws_summarize_conversation` and attach fields to that dict directly (no extra parsing step).

- Why it saves time:
  - Less CPU work and fewer failure cases. Summary generation is now more reliable and quicker.

## quick map of files touched

- aws_client.py
  - One-pass validation with targeted fix in `Neo4jQueryEngine._aquery`.
  - Redis schema caching with TTL in `get_neo4j_schema`.
  - Added `import re` used by formatting helpers.

- explorer.py
  - Switched from blocking `requests` to async `httpx` in `_generate_entity_details_cypher`.

- semantic_introspector.py
  - Added Redis caching for introspection output with a 6-hour TTL.

- entity_routes.py
  - Awaited calls to `explore_entity`.
  - Removed double-parsing of the AWS summary dict.
  - Reused the global graph store (`Settings.graph_store`) if present to avoid creating another Neo4j connection.

## how to sanity-check the improvements

- Run two similar queries back-to-back:
  - The second one should be faster, thanks to schema/introspection caching and a leaner validation cycle.
- Hit an entity endpoint while load-testing with a few parallel requests:
  - With async HTTP to the Java service, the server should remain more responsive under concurrency (fewer “all requests stall” moments).
- If you update the Neo4j schema and want a fresh read immediately:
  - Bump the schema cache version in code from v1 to v2 (or explicitly delete the Redis key). Same for introspection.

## status and next steps

- Static checks on changed files: pass (no syntax/type errors detected on the edited modules).
- Next low-risk wins if you want them:
  - Add a small admin endpoint to clear cache keys (schema/introspection) on demand.
  - Cache LLM “plan” outputs keyed by normalized query + context for an even bigger speedup on repeated questions.

If you want me to add a tiny “cache-bust” admin endpoint (e.g., POST /admin/cache/clear?what=schema|introspection), I can wire that up next.
